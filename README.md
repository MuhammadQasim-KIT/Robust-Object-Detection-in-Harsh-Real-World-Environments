# Robust Object Detection in Harsh Real-World Environments  
### Visual & Quantitative Evaluation of Perception Reliability

This project evaluates how modern object detection systems behave when operating in **challenging, real-world environmental conditions** such as:

- Dust / haze  
- Low light  
- Motion blur  
- Sensor noise  

It demonstrates an **end-to-end AI perception pipeline**, focusing on **robustness, reliability, and real-world practicality** — essential for robotics, autonomous systems, and industrial AI.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

✔️ Run baseline object detection on a clean environment  
✔️ Generate a harsh-environment simulation of the same scene  
✔️ Evaluate how detection quality changes  
✔️ Present visual and quantitative results clearly

# 📊 Quantitative Results

Beyond visuals, the system was evaluated numerically.

## 📌 Vehicle Detections Per Frame

![Detections](results/plots/carss_detections_vs_frame.png)

**Insight**
- Clean environment detects **more vehicles consistently**
- Harsh environments cause a **drop in detections**
- Indicates missing important objects

---

## 📌 Mean Detection Confidence Per Frame

![Confidence](results/plots/carss_confidence_vs_frame.png)

**Insight**
- Clean scenes → higher confidence & stability  
- Harsh scenes → fluctuating and lower confidence  
- AI becomes uncertain → reduced reliability

# 🧠 Key Findings

✔️ Object detection significantly weakens in poor environments  
✔️ Both accuracy **and confidence** drop  
✔️ System becomes less reliable and potentially unsafe  

This highlights the importance of:
- Robust perception engineering  
- Domain adaptation  
- Multi-sensor fusion  
- Real-world testing beyond clean datasets
